Maria Barrios Filipino Language Consulting (MBFLC), first registered in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and operating since 2008, is a sole proprietorship with the business address, 1229B University Avenue, Berkeley, CA.  

****

The business specializes in Filipino languages, such as: Tagalog, Ilocano, Cebuano, Pampango,  Pangasinense, and the national language called Filipino.  We offer the following services to our clients:  translation work; interpreting, localization, developement of language teaching and assessment materials,  and legal consulting on Filipino language, culture and history.  

****

For translation and localization projects, we have a four-step process.  All texts go through a translator, an editor, and a proofreader. After proofreading, the text then goes back to the translator for finalization. Additionally, we provide a glossary for each project to the client. This ensures consistency and can be used by the client for future projects.  

****

Our business is unique because of the following reasons:

1\.  We concentrate on the languages of the Philippines;

2\.  All our lead translators and editors are language teachers at the University of California Berkeley, as well as published authors of Filipino language textbooks. The UC Berkeley Filipino language program is currently the largest and most accomplished Filipino-as-a-second-language program in the world. 

3\.  We work directly with clients eliminating middleman costs. For example, fee charges for translation, editing and proofreading go directly to the translator, editor and proofreader. In the past, our translators/editors had worked for translation companies for low fees, while these companies charged high rates to their clients. Because we are a small group of three UC Berkeley teachers (working with back-up translators), we don't have maintenance or overhead costs.  

4\.  We can offer creative translation services. Our team members are published and award-winning creative writers.
